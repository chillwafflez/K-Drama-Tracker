# K-Drama-Tracker-Backend
Project to create the REST API for a show-tracker using Flask. This is primarily for me to learn more backend development, as I am recreating a backend in my own way, as well as gaining experience with a new framework and web scraping. This is still a work in progress and I will continue to implement features and best practices.

Below is my current schema. I am currently using a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS.
